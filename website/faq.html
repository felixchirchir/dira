        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none">

            Dira Cloud is a company that offers cloud-based billing solutions specifically designed for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) using MikroTik routers. It provides a billing system that integrates seamlessly with MikroTik routers to manage and automate billing for both hotspot and PPPoE services.

        <h3 class="faq-question">How does Dira Cloud's billing system integrate with a MikroTik router for hotspot services?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none">
          <p>
            Dira Cloud's billing system integrates with a MikroTik router by configuring the router to handle user authentication and authorization through a captive portal. When a user connects to the hotspot, they are redirected to the billing system where they can log in, purchase a data package, or pay for usage. The system tracks their session duration or data usage, generates an invoice, and can automatically disconnect users when their balance is exhausted.

        <h3 class="faq-question">How does the billing system handle PPPoE billing?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none">
          <p>
            For PPPoE users, the Dira Cloud billing system integrates with the MikroTik router to manage user authentication and bandwidth limits. Customers authenticate via their PPPoE credentials, and the billing system monitors their usage (such as bandwidth or session time). It supports prepaid and postpaid models, automatically generating bills based on usage, or setting fixed monthly charges. The system can also send automated notifications when users are approaching their limits or when a payment is due.

        <div class="faq-answer" style="display: none">
          <p>
